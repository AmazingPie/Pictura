# TODO

- Add gif/mp4 support for img_windows.

- Add button to hide (iconify) all img_windows.

- Add button to remove all img_windows.

- Add filename below/above viewport.

- Add buttons to navigate to nearby (ordered by date) images in viewport.

- Add Gallery:
	- Gallery is a seperate area to add images from the viewport. This allows the user to store images that they find and open up again later. This would include the ability to:
	- Select (put a border around) an image in the gallery.
	- Double clicking an image in the gallery adds it back to the viewport.
	- Have a button in the controls to add a button to the viewport.

- Add controls to tessallate images onto screen.
	- Maybe user needs to input resolution of monitor/tessallation size and number of images (vertical, horizontal/mixed).
	- The application can then spawn that number of images tessallated accross a screen in some pre-determined patterns.
	- Some fixed patterns could include:
		- 4 horizontal in grid.
		- 2 horizontal, two vertical in middle and two more horizontal.
		- 2 vertical.
